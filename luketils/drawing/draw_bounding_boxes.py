        color: the color in which to plot the bounding boxes
        bounding_box_format: The format of bounding boxes to plot onto the images. Refer
          [to the keras.io docs](https://keras.io/api/keras_cv/bounding_box/formats/)
          for more details on supported bounding box formats.
        thickness: (Optional) thickness for the box and text labels.  Defaults to 2.
        text_thickness: (Optional) the thickness for the text, defaults to `1.0`.
        font_scale: (Optional) scale of font to draw in.  Defaults to `1.0`.
